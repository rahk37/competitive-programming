 * A flow layout manager takes rectangular objects and places them in a rectangular window from left to right.
 * If there isnâ€™t enough room in one row for an object, it is placed completely below all the objects in the first
 * row at the left edge, where the order continues from left to right again.
 *
 * This program takes a set of rectangle dimensions and a max window width from the console
 * and computes the dimensions of the final window after all the rectangles have been placed in it.
